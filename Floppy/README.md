# FLOPPY

The floppy file is downloadable from the library room in the Novem Portis track.
The file itself is named `floppy` without any extension, but an examination of the file header and format 
shows it is a FAT floppy image. 
The file may be mounted directly in Linux:
```
mount -o loop ./floppy /media/temp
```
